Here are additional comments added to the code:

bins_to_bytes() function converts a binary string to a bytearray by iterating over the binary string and converting 8 bits at a time to an integer, and then using bytearray() to convert the integers to bytes.

char_to_bin() function converts a file to a binary string by iterating over the characters in the file, getting their ASCII values using ord(), converting the ASCII values to binary using format() with a format specifier of '08b' to ensure each binary representation has 8 bits, and then joining the binary representations together to form a single binary string.

get_cpu_count() function returns the number of CPUs (or workers) available in the system using the multiprocessing.cpu_count() function from the multiprocessing module.

get_pool_size() function creates and returns a multiprocessing.Pool object with the specified number of workers (obtained from get_cpu_count() function) that can be used for parallel processing.

openfile() function takes a file path as input and returns the file contents as a bytearray by using the bytearray() function to convert the file into a bytearray.

xor_cipher() function performs XOR encryption/decryption on a binary string (text_binary) using a key binary string (key_binary) by XORing each character in the text_binary with the corresponding character in the key_binary using bitwise XOR (^), and then returning the resulting binary string.

xor_worker() function is a helper function that performs the actual XOR encryption/decryption in parallel using multiple workers. It divides the file into chunks of binary strings, distributes them among the workers for processing, and then returns the results as a list of binary strings.

XOR_encryption() function is the entry point for XOR encryption. It calls openfile() function to read the file contents, passes the file contents and the encryption key to xor_worker() function for parallel processing, and then calls bins_to_bytes() function to convert the resulting binary string back to a bytearray.

XOR_decryption() function is similar to XOR_encryption() function, but it performs XOR decryption instead of encryption. It reads the file contents using openfile() function, passes the file contents and the decryption key to xor_worker() function for parallel processing, and then calls bins_to_bytes() function to convert the resulting binary string back to a bytearray.

Both XOR_encryption() and XOR_decryption() functions are wrapped in try-except blocks to catch any exceptions that may occur during file processing, and print the type of exception caught.
